# Dart IndexOutOfRangeException
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfRangeException`.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element of a list using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential error.

This is a simple example to illustrate how easily this type of error can occur and how to prevent it.
